<h1>Workout Log</h1>
If this doesn't interest you, go back to <a href="index.html">my webpage</a>.

<p>I hope to update this page weekly if not daily, going forward. For now, I have a log, in reverse chronological order,
worth only two weeks or so. 
I am a fan of outdoor cardio (read: biking, hiking, walking), indoor weight training and of course, Tae-Kwon-Do. 
I will not be posting my outdoor cardio activity here 
because it happens in spurts and I don't really see it as an 'exercise'. For me, it's recreation - 
I can do hours and hours of it before getting tired. As far as Tae-Kwon-Do, I try to incorporate it as 
much as I can in my daily workout routine. </p>

<p>I do most of my exercises in the sets of 3 - 12 repetition in each, unless otherwise mentioned. Usually, I do not 
target specific muscles per workout- I just go with what I feel like. I like to alternate between upper and lower body
exercises because it keeps your heart rate up and you can get done in less than 30 minutes. 
Also, 
I am not endorsing this style of workout for anyone - you must be aware of your own physical limitations and 
consult with a medical professional before you embark on any fitness program. The key is to eat right and listen to your
body.</p>
