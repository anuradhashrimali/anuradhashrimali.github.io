<h1> Welcome</h1>
<p>This is yet another version of my webpage. So...hi again!</p>
<body>

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>  I am Anuradha Shrimali and prefer to go by Anu. I am originally from Mumbai, India but currently live in Plano, TX. There are several ways to contact me, 

some of which are - <a href="mailto:anushrimali@gmail.com">email</a> and <a href="www.linkedin.com/pub/anuradha-shrimali/9/927/258/"> LinkedIn</a>. For an 

updated resume, please email me.</p>

<p> My hobbies include hiking, biking, kayaking, lifting heavy weights and solving puzzles like sudoku, hitori and rubik's cube. I am a Blue-I belt in Tae-

Kwon-Do. I have a workout log and will update it here under a separate tab.</p>

<p> I have studied at the following extraordinary educational institutions (in chronological order):
<li><a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani</a><br> BITS was my home away-from-home for four years. I learnt a 

lot during these years - I went from a naive 17-year-old teenager to a not-so-naive 21-year-old. To say the least, I graduated as a different person. I will 

always cherish the memories and the family of friends I made in this beautiful campus. Here's a picture of the tree in 2014 that I planted as a sapling in 2005 

and some of my friends and I outside our hostel. <br>

<br>I will upload more pictures in a separate tab later.

<li><a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/">Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</a><br>IMSc is a research institute supported by the Department of Atomic 

Energy.  Institute members work primarily in the areas of Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Physics. I spent a year here studying under 

some of the most brilliant yet humble professors I have ever met. IMSc uploads informative lecture videos on their YouTube channel. You can check them out <a 

href="https://www.youtube.com/user/matsciencechannel">here</a>. You also might be interested in one of the Math professor <a 

href="https://www.youtube.com/user/amriprasad">Dr. Amritanshu Prasad's YouTube channel</a>.</li><br>
<li><a href="">Stony Brook University, New York </a><br>I first came to a new country, rather, a new continent in 2010 to study what I love the most - Math. I 

truly had an international experience collaborating and making friends with people all over the globe. Here are some pictures of some of us on our way to West 

Meadow Beach in the first few weeks of graduate school.  <br><img width="200px" height="125px"

Lastly, here's a picture of my cousin's labrador pup, Buzo. Buzo is a month old in this picture.
