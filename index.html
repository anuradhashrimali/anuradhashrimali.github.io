<h1> Welcome</h1>
<p>This is yet another version of my webpage. So...hi again!</p>

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>  I am Anuradha Shrimali and prefer to go by Anu. I am originally from Mumbai, India but currently live in Plano, TX. There are several ways to contact me, some of which are - <a href="mailto:anushrimali@gmail.com">email</a> and <a href="www.linkedin.com/pub/anuradha-shrimali/9/927/258/"> LinkedIn</a>. </p>

<p> My hobbies include hiking, biking, lifting heavy weights and solving puzzles like sudoku, hitori and rubik's cube. I am a Blue-I belt in Tae-Kwon-Do. I have a workout log and will update it here under a separate tab.</p>

<p> I have studied at the following extraordinary educational institutions (in chronological order):
<li><a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani</a><br> BITS was my home away-from-home for four years. I learnt a lot during these years - I went from a naive 17-year-old teenager to a not-so-naive 21-year-old. To say the least, I graduated as a different person. I will always cherish the memories and a family of friends I made in this beautiful campus. Here's a picture of the tree in 2014 that I planted outside my hostel in 2005. <br>

<li><a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/">Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</a><br>IMSc is a research institute supported by the Department of Atomic Energy.  Institute members work primarily in the areas of Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Physics. I spent a year here studying under some of the most brilliant yet humble professors I have met. IMSc uploads informative lecture videos on their YouTube channel. You can check them out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/matsciencechannel">here</a>. You also might be interested in one of the Math professor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/amriprasad">Dr. Amritanshu Prasad's YouTube channel</a>.</li><br>
<li><a href="">Stony Brook University, New York </a><br>I first came to a new country, rather, a new continent in 2010 to study what I love the most - Math. I truly had an international experience collaborating and making friends with people all over the globe. Here's a picture of some of us walking to West Meadow Beach in the first few weeks of school.  <br>
