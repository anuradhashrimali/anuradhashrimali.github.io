<h1> Welcome</h1>
<p>This is yet another version of my webpage. So...hi again!</p>
<body>
<div>
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>  I am Anuradha Shrimali and prefer to go by Anu. I am originally from Mumbai, India 
but currently live in Plano, TX. There are several ways to contact me, some of which are -
<a href="mailto:anushrimali@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> and
<a href="http://linkedin.com/pub/anuradha-shrimali/9/927/258/" target="_blank"> LinkedIn</a>. 
For an updated resume, please email me.</p>

<p> My hobbies include hiking, biking, kayaking, lifting weights and solving puzzles like sudoku, 
hitori and rubik's cube. I am a Blue-I belt in Tae-Kwon-Do.</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p> I have studied at the following extraordinary educational institutions (in chronological order):
<li><a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank">Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani</a><br> 
BITS was my home away-from-home for four years. I learnt a lot during these years - 
I went from a naive 17-year-old teenager to a not-so-naive 21-year-old. To say the least, 
I graduated as a different person. I will always cherish the memories and the family of friends 
I made in this beautiful campus. Here's a picture of the tree 9 years after I planted it and some of my friends and 
I outside our hostel. <br>

<br>I will upload more pictures in a separate tab later.

<li><a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/" target="_blank">Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</a><br>
IMSc is a research institute supported by the Department of Atomic Energy.  Institute members work 
primarily in the areas of Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Physics. 
I spent a year here studying under some of the most brilliant yet humble professors I have ever met. 
IMSc uploads informative lecture videos on their YouTube channel. You can check them out 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/matsciencechannel" target="_blank">here</a>. 
You also might be interested in one of the math professors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/amriprasad" target="_blank">Dr. Amritanshu Prasad's YouTube channel</a>.</li><br>


<li><a href="http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/" target="_blank">Stony Brook University, New York </a><br>I first came to a new country, rather, a new continent in 2010 to study what I love the most - Math. 
I truly had an international experience collaborating and making friends with people all over the globe. 
Here are a few pictures of some of us on our way to West Meadow Beach in the first few weeks of graduate school.  
<br><img width="200px" height="125px" src="http://i1370.photobucket.com/albums/ag268/anushrimali/Picture239_zps1163de39.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo Picture239_zps1163de39.jpg"/><img width="200px" height="125px"  src="http://i1370.photobucket.com/albums/ag268/anushrimali/Picture253_zps36aa4ff8.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo Picture253_zps36aa4ff8.jpg"/><br></li><br>
I had a few cool graphs from one of my courses, Numerical Analysis III, on my student webpage on SUNY's AMS website. 
However, they have taken it down since I graduated. Once I find a way to retrieve them, I will put them up here.</div>
